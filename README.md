### Python Application for Vaccine Scheduler

This system allows patients and caregivers to reserve and manage vaccine appointments. Initially, a user must create a profile and login. From there, depending on their role as patient or caregiver, they can perform various actions. For example, caregivers can upload their availability and manage the vaccine dose inventory. Patients can reserve appointments. All users can search availabilities and show their booked appointments.

Certain methods and backend connections were given to me. I designed the schema of the different tables that were stored in a SQL Server hosted on Microsoft Azure. I implemented the rest of the methods and classes for the different roles.

Future direction could be implementing more methods for users and designing a UI. This project served as a great introduction to the backend of reservation platforms.
